    <h2>Problem solving</h2>
    <pre>
<p>Problem solving is a process of identifying a problem and finding the best solution for 
it. Problem solving is a skill that can be developed by following a well organized approach.
We solve different problem every day. Every problem is different in its nature. Some problem
are difficult and required more attention to identify the solution.
(1) Program
(2) Algorithm
(3) Flowchart</p>
    </pre>

    <h2>Program</h2>
    <pre>
<p>A set of instructioon that tells a computer what to do is called program. A computer 
works according to the given instruction in the program. Computer programs are written 
in programming languages. A person who develops a program is called programmer.  
Example:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  cout << i << endl;
}</p>
    </pre>

    <h2>Algorithm & Pseudo code</h2>
    <pre>
<p>An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem. The process of solving a problem 
becomes simpler and easier with help of algorithm. Algorithms are written in a language that is 
similar to simple English called pseudo code.   
Example:
1. Start
2. Input A
3. Input B
4. Total = A + B
5. Display Total
6. Exit</p>
